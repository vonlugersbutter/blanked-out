Hello! Thank you for calling. Please hold.

This is a repository of medical notes written by an MD-PhD student in Canada. It gives me an excuse to actually enjoy the content I'm studying, helps me be more thorough, and forms a small step towards fulfilling my childhood dream of writing a fat textbook one day. 

It was inspired by [Deranged Physiology](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/home), all of those neocities websites I keep seeing, and every Theodore Gray book I have ever read. It gives me a place to be sarcastic and witty and share what I know without bothering people who don't want to hear it. I also personally don't like it when medical school notes online are packed with abbreviations and are not thorough in their explanations; to address this gap will be a personal goal of mine. I am also somewhat sickened by how expensive things are in the general field of medical education, so will not hold this behind a paywall.

All relevant pages and sections are available using the Explorer, and below. This website is a work in progress.
