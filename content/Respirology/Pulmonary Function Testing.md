# Indications for a PFT
- Pt has respiratory symptoms
- Need to tell how bad it is
- Monitor how bad the disease is getting
- Screen patients
- Check response to therapy (like post-bronchodilation in asthma)
- Determine fitness for things like thoracic surgery
# All the usual values of lung volumes and capacities
![](00%20media/{4790CB4F-4DC5-4167-A15A-4D15F8484F3D}.png)
# Contraindications of testing
## Absolute contraindications
- Unstable cardiac disease or recent MI (1 week)
- Recent or unresolved pneumothorax
- Eye surgery (1 week) â†’ increased pressure during forced exhalation can damage the eye
- Abdominal, thoracic, or brain surgery (4 weeks)
## Relative contraindications
- Stress incontinence
- Dementia or confusion
# Components of a PFT
- Spirometry (10-15 min): check for airflow obstruction
- Lung volumes: static, and lung capacity
- Diffusion capacity, checking for gas exchange
- PFT generally consists of **spirometry, lung volumes, and gas transfer**
- Respiratory muscle strength
- Airway responsiveness
- Compliance of the lungs
# Things that determine lung volumes
- Height, age sex
	- After age 20-25, lung volumes decrease 30 mL/year
- Moving away from ethnicity
- Use the Global Lung Initiative predictive values
# Spirometry
- FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second
- FVC = forced vital capacity
- FEV1/FVC = if low, airway obstruction

A flow volume loop. Note the rounded inhalation, and the spike for exhalation.

What different pathologies look like. The airflow obstruction here would be a smaller one, like asthma. Also, they say non-obstructive defect, because apparently you can't say that its a restrictive defect if you don't have the total lung capacity.

## For large obstructions
Inspiration isn't very good here, and so that points to an extrathoracic obstruction, like a vocal cord lesion.

In this next example, expiration isn't very good, and we don't see that scooping from the small obstruction above. This is likely a large intrathoracic obstruction, like an aspirated foreign body.

In a fixed central airway obstruction, both phases look bad. This is probably something like a tracheal tumor.

# Interpreting spirometry and lung volumes
A very useful differential diagnosis flowchart, from AMBOSS. It says here to use percentages like 70% or 80%, but it is usually also a good idea to look at the lower limit of the normal.

Note also, the GOLD criteria, which is especially used for COPD.

The volumes can be measured by body plethysmography (non-invasive lung function test performed in an airtight box (a plethysmograph) that measures lung volumes and airway resistance) or by using a gas dilution technique like helium. Apparently, the gas dilution technique doesn't measure dead space. Still working on 

Re-iterating these values, in obstructive lung diseases, the lung is very compliant, but elasticity is low. This leads to a drop in IRV, TV, and an increase in ERV and RV. ERV + RV = FRC, so FRC also goes up. Essentially, their lungs are huge (the barrel chest), and that also makes TLC quite high. In a restricted lung disease, IRV, TV, ERV, and FRC are all low. Elasticity is very high. TLC is very low. 

In an obstructive lung disease, the flow-volume curve will shift to the left, reflecting these changes. In a restrictive lung disease, it will shift to the right. Right for restrictive.

In spirometry, obstructive lung diseases will have a very low FEV1, and a slightly low FVC. The problem is getting the air out quickly. And so, FEV1/FVC will be very low, below 70%. In a restrictive lung disease, the problem isn't really getting the air out quickly. It's getting the air in and out at all. So, FEV1 will be slightly low, but FVC will be considerably low. This means FEV1/FVC will be greater than or equal to 70%. After that measurement, you'd have to check TLC and RV to check and see the difference between restrictive and obstructive. 

Note that COPD is not really reversible by bronchodilators like SABA (short-acting beta 2 agonist). Asthma can be reversible to largely normal using SABA, and can also be hyperresponsive to methacholine (drop in FEV1 of greater than or equal to 20%). 
# DLCO
You get the patient to breathe in a little bit of CO, and detect how much of it was actually taken up by the blood.
$$
DLCO \propto \frac{SA}{thickness}
$$
Where $SA$ is the surface area available for gas exchange. 
## Drop in DLCO
- Obstructive lung disease
	- Emphysema due to an increased surface area, while you wouldn't really see that in a disease like asthma
- Restrictive lung disease
	- Interstitial lung diseases, the DLCO decreases due to a thickness increase; his is not something you would see in extrinsic restrictive diseases like neuromuscular disorders
- Anemia (not enough functional hemoglobin to actually take the gas up)
- Recent smoking, carbon monoxide already in the blood, reduces diffusion gradient for more CO to get in
## Increase in DLCO (less clinically significant)
- Alveolar hemorrhage (the blood is right there, CO will get taken up)
- Asthma (increased pulmonary capillary blood volume, enhanced perfusion of lung apices, increased airway vascularization leading to a larger capillary surface area)
- Polycythemia (more blood cells)
- L to R shunt (more blood coming in to bind the CO)
