# Obstructive lung diseases
- 3 things that cause obstruction in the airway
	- Stuff stuck inside the lumen (mucus, in chronic bronchitis; aspirated material)
	- Issues with airway walls 
	- Destruction of parenchyma, loss of radial traction → airway narrowing

Examples include:
- [COPD](Respirology/Respiratory%20Pathologies/COPD.md)
# Restrictive lung diseases
- Could be because of issues with the lung parenchyma, or because of issues with the pleura, chest wall, or neuro-musculature → basically, the expansion of the lung is restricted
- Note that mixed restrictive and obstructive lung diseases can occur
## Diseases of the lung parenchyma
- [Interstitial lung diseases](Respirology/Respiratory%20Pathologies/Interstitial%20lung%20diseases.md)
- [Sarcoidosis](Respirology/Respiratory%20Pathologies/Sarcoidosis.md)
