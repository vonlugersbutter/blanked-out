# Obstructive lung diseases
- 3 things that cause obstruction in the airway
	- Stuff stuck inside the lumen (mucus, in chronic bronchitis; aspirated material)
	- Issues with airway walls 
	- Destruction of parenchyma, loss of radial traction → airway narrowing
## COPD 
- (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
- Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or a mixture thereof
- 3 factors
	- Airflow obstruction
	- Chronic respiratory symptoms
	- Risk factor (smoking, air pollution)

The whole reason a diagnosis of COPD is used is because its difficult to distinguish the extent of emphysema or chronic bronchitis. 
### Emphysema
- Enlargement of the air spaces, after terminal bronchiole; destruction of walls
- Loss of alveolar walls, destruction of the capillaries, small sparse airways, narrowed 
- Types of emphysema
	- Centriacinar → central part of the lobule, alveolar sacs left alone
		- Apex, spreads down to go to the alveoli
		- Very common, usually cigarette smoke
	- Panacinar → distension, destruction of the whole lobule
		- Severe form can be seen in those that have **alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency** → genetic disease, not enough 
			- The enzyme protects tissues from enzymes of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil elastase
			- If smoking or air pollution is occurring, those immune cells can come in and fight it, but there's nothing to stop them, so they end up damaging the elastic tissues in the lungs
#### Okay, why does it happen?
- Too much of that lysosomal elastase and neutrophil enzymes that end up destroying the lung (cleaves elastin and collagen)
- Interestingly, when animals are given these enzymes, they end up developing the same symptoms
- Cigarette smoke also encourages immune cells to stay in the lungs 
#### How come people who don't smoke heavily (and presumably have no genetic susceptibility) also get this?
- Unclear
### Chronic bronchitis
- Too much mucus production → on most days, at least 3 months in the year, for 2 years
- Mucus production measured using the Reid index, which feels a bit random
- Small airways narrowed, inflammatory changes, cell infiltration, edema 
- Bronchial smooth muscle increases, fibrosis may develop → growth factors secreted such as TGF-β contribute to this
#### Hmm I wonder how it happens
- Smoking → repeated irritation results in chronic inflammation; note that smog can also do this
### Type A and B COPD
Basically two extremes of clinical presentation. Most people have features of both. 

The main difference? **Severe hypoxemia** in type B, which leads to higher incidence of cor pulmonale → failure of the right ventricle of the heart as a response to increased vascular resistance.

### How does this show up on spirometry?
- Things that get low: FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, FEF, Vmax 50%, Vmax 75%
- This is caused by airway obstruction, mucus in the lumen, thickening of the walls, loss of radial traction
- FVC is reduced because airways close prematurely during exhalation when lung volume is really high, giving increased residual volume
