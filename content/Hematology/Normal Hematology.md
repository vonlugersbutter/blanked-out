# Blood
- Liquid connective tissue, where the ECM is plasma
- Interstitial fluid is the fluid that bathes body cells → constantly renewed by blood
- Functions: transportation, regulation, protection

We start as we always do: with lovely diagrams from Tortora. Note the Buffy coat, the various proteins, cells, and solutes found throughout.

- Hepatocytes synthesize most plasma proteins, such as albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen
- Hematocrit = percentage of total blood volume occupied by RBCs, usually around 38 to 54%
	- Higher in males, because testosterone makes more erythropoietin
- Polycythemia = too many RBCs, hematocrit >65% → resistance to flow, high blood pressure
## Making blood cells
- Red bone marrow = vascularized connective tissue, mainly in the axial skeleton
- Yellow bone marrow = largely fat cells → forms from red bone marrow with age

- Some stem cells make osteoblasts, chondroblasts, muscle cells
- Reticular cells produce reticular fibers, which form stroma that supports red bone marrow cells
- Blood from nutrient and metaphyseal arteries enters bone, passes into leaky capillaries called sinuses → when they form, they enter the blood vessels through nutrient and periosteal veins 
- Only lymphocytes divide after leaving the bone marrow, no other hematopoietic cells do
- Thrombopoietin is produced by the liver, makes more platelets from megakaryocytes
