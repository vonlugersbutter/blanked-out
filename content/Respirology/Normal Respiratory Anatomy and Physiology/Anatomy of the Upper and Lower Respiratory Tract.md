A long form view of the entire respiratory system. Note the difference between pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration.

Another long form view. Note some of the muscles that can be used for forced inspiration, such as the anterior scalene muscle. Note also the pericardial sac, with the heart inside of it, and how it takes away room from the left lung.

# Upper respiratory tract
Bones and cartilages of the nose. They do look rather nice.

Another good diagram, taken right from Tortora. A few important things to note. The conchae, and the meatuses between them serve to warm, moisten, and condition air as it comes in. The opening of the auditory tube, which can get blocked with mucus, or lead to fluid buildup and inflammation in the middle ear, or **otitis media** (see [Pneumonia](Respirology/Respiratory%20Pathologies/Pneumonia.md)). We can see some of the sinuses (frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary), which allow for resonance in phonation. These also allow for some degree of humidification. Olfactory epithelium at the top, which helps for (gee I wonder what) olfaction. The upper airway formally stops at the larynx, and then it's lower airway. Note the lingual, palatine, and pharyngeal tonsils, which are lymphoid tissue. There are some important epithelial tissue type differences. The nasopharynx is ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to trap and clear debris from the air, while the oropharynx and laryngopharynx are non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium for protection against abrasion when swallowing food.

Another nice view of the conchae and meatuses. Here, note that maxillary sinuses, the ethmoidal cells, the vomer, the brain, and the optic nerve.

# Larynx
The larynx has nine pieces of cartilage: thyroid, cricoid, epiglottis, paired corniculate, paired arytenoid, and paired cuneiform. The cuneiform here can only be seen on the sagittal view. Note the hyoid bone, which is the only bone in the human body that is not connected to any other bones. Another piece of anatomical trivia which I think has no practical medical use, but is fun to use to show off during class sessions. Note the thyroid and parathyroid glands.

Yet another mildly useful diagram. Note the vocal and vestibular folds, the vestibular ones being superior in position and more pink in appearance. The vocal folds are supposed to appear more white.

Adduction versus abduction. According to Tortora, "contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, for example, moves the vocal folds apart (abduction), thereby opening the rima glottidis. By contrast, contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles moves the vocal folds together (adduction), closing the rima glottidis". I don't particularly like that paragraph, or this diagram, because this information seems like it would be more useful to a speech pathologist than to a medical student.

# Trachea
Ah, yes. Getting down closer to the lungs. The esophagus looks quite loose, compared to the rigid structure of the trachea afforded by the C-shaped rings of cartilage. On the posterior side, we have the trachealis muscle. Note that the epithelial surface here has pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelial cells and goblet cells (for producing mucus). Aptly named the mucociliary apparatus. It's nice that the trachea only has partial rings, so that food can go down easily from the esophagus.

# Lungs
LUNGS. Finally.

Note the carina, not shown, which is the bifurcation of the trachea. It also contains a very high density of irritant receptors. The terminal bronchioles represent the end of the conducting zone. Note the horizontal fissure on the right lung, absent on the left. Note the three lobes of the right lung, and only two of the left lung. Note the little lingula (little, little tongue. Ha!) near the cardiac notch. The heart really does insist on taking up quite a bit of space.

Once we get to the bronchi, a few important changes to keep in mind. Tortora manages to explain this in a very confusingly-worded way.
1. Main, lobar, segmental bronchi → ciliated pseudostratified columnar
2. Larger bronchioles → ciliated simple columnar with goblet cells
3. Smaller bronchioles → ciliated simple cuboidal, no goblet cells
4. Terminal bronchioles → nonciliated simple cuboidal, no goblet cells

If there are no cilia, the macrophages do the job of clearing stuff up. The incomplete rings of cartilage in the main bronchus are replaced by plates, which then disappear farther down. The cartilage is replaced by smooth muscle.

> [!Info] Airway smooth muscle responsiveness
> - Sympathetic activity → adrenal medulla releases norepinephrine and epinephrine → relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchioles → bigger airways
> - Parasympathetic activity + histamine → contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscle → smaller airways
