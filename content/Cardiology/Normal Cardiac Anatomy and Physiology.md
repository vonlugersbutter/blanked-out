# Structure of the heart
We start, again, with some lovely diagrams from Tortora, depicting the heart and its location in the mediastinum.

The pericardium surrounds and protects the heart, and consists of the fibrous (dense irregular connective tissue) and serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is fused to the central tendon of the diaphragm through the pericardiophrenic ligament; anchors the heart, movement of the diaphragm eases movement of blood. The serous pericardium, then, is double-layered, made up of the parietal and visceral layers. The visceral layer of the serous pericardium is the epicardium.

The serous pericardium has serous fluid between its layers, and the potential space that it occupies it is called the pericardial cavity. This can get inflamed, in pericarditis, and cause a pericardial friction rub. There are grooves called sulci on the surface of the heart that house the coronary vessels. 
## Epicardium
This also has two layers (so many layers!). Beneath the mesothelium that forms the visceral layer of the serous pericardium, there is another layer of fibroelastic and adipose tissue.
## Myocardium
The muscle, makes up most of the heart. Consists of bundles of involuntary striated cells. 
## Endocardium
Smooth lining inside the heart, that would help prevent friction. It is continuous with the endothelial lining of the great vessels attached to the heart. 
## Blood supply of the heart
The aorta has small branches that come off of it, called the left and right coronary arteries. These branch out from behind two of the cusps of the aortic valve.

As blood recoils after ventricular systole, it fills those aortic sinus, and then fills the arteries. Makes sense; we wouldn't want the intense pressure of blood coming straight out of the left ventricle to blow up these small arteries.

The arteries divide as follows. 
- Left coronary artery
	- Left anterior descending artery (lies in the AIVS, supplies LV and RV)
	- Left circumflex artery (wraps around heart, supplies LA and LV)
- Right coronary artery (small branches to right atrium)
	- Posterior interventricular artery (lies in the PIVS, supplies RV and LV)
	- Right marginal artery (supplies RV)

The venous return of the heart is as follows.
- Small cardiac vein (drains RA and RV)
- Anterior cardiac vein (drains RV, opens into RA)
- Middle cardiac vein (lies in the PIVS, drains LV and RV)
- Great cardiac vein (runs beside circumflex artery, drains LA, LV, RV)
- Gray's also suggests there's a posterior cardiac vein, the one that looks like its branching off from the great cardiac vein. Unclear what that's draining, but it's probably the LV. 
All these veins, except the anterior cardiac vein, drain into the coronary sinus. It has a thin wall, which then drains into the RA.

Also note that there are some discrepancies from person to person.
