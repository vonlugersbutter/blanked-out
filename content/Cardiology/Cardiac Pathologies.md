# Cor pulmonale
- Enlargement and failure of the right ventricle, because of increased pulmonary vascular resistance 
- If it is more acute, it would involve dilation, and if it is more chronic, it involves right ventricle hypertrophy
- Pulmonary heart disease, also known as cor pulmonale, is the enlargement and failure of the right ventricle of the heart as a response to increased vascular resistance 
- Chronic pressure overload, secondary pulmonary hypertension → vascular changes as a result of tissue damage (e.g. disease, hypoxic injury), and chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Early stages → increasing contractility, little to no hypertrophy
- Ventricular dilation, accompanied by rising filling pressures, decreased contractility, loss of synchronicity as the right ventricle becomes more spherical, and dilation of the tricuspid valve annulus
- JVP due to back up of blood in superior vena cava and jugular veins
