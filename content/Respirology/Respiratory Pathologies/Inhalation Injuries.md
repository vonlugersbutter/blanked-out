Caused by inhalation of toxins, smoke, hot steam, particulate matter, irritants, caustic gastric contents.
- Supraglottic injuries: mainly due to thermal damage, which leads to epithelial sloughing, hypersecretion, and airway obstruction from swelling and secretions 
- Subglottic injuries: due to chemical irritation, which leads to epithelial damage, hypersecretion, impaired ciliary function, and potential airway obstruction

Pulmonary edema, airway obstruction, bronchospasm can ensue. 
# Treatment
- Oxygen therapy, monitor CO2, pulse oximetry, obtain chest x-ray for complications (pulmonary edema, ARDS), early intubation
- Assess airway damage using laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy
