# Diabetic gastroparesis
Delayed gastric emptying, mainly because of poor glycemic control in diabetes and obesity. The neuronal damage from the high blood sugar leads to impaired gastric function. So, the stomach cannot empty properly. This leads to nausea and vomiting. 
# Microvascular disease
Usually starts 5 to 10 years after onset of the disease, and occurs if it is poorly controlled. Basal membranes start to thicken. Various immune factors can contribute to this, including PKC, TGF-B, VEGF, oxidative stress, the coagulation cascade, TNF-a, and even hyperglycemic pseudohypoxia. 

The hyperglycemic pseudohypoxia occurs when there is oxygen available to the cell, but it cannot use it due to the imbalance of NADH/NAD+ (i.e., there is too much NADH). Two pathways use this NAD+, aldose reductase in the polyol pathway and poly (ADP ribose) poylmerases (PARPs), activated during DNA repair. If large amounts of glucose are present, hexokinase gets saturated, excess glucose enters the polyol pathway when aldose reductase reduces it to sorbitol, and then to fructose. Sorbitol can't cross tissues, draws water in in the glucose-independent tissues. In both pathways, NADH is less available. Cells starve.

According to Murray and Nadel, in diabetes:
- Hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is higher
- High prevalence of pulmonary hypertension
- Pulmonary fibrosis can also occur
- Low insulin levels, reduce metabolism of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase â†’ more ketones in the plasma, the liver can't take up lactate, so that builds up in the blood
	- Elevated lactate could also be caused by extracellular fluid volume depletion due to osmotic diuresis due to hyperglycemia (increased urine production because of high concentrations of glucose, in the kidney's tubules, preventing water reabsorption)
# Cardiac complications
From a more cardiological perspective, pain during MI in diabetic patients may be silent
