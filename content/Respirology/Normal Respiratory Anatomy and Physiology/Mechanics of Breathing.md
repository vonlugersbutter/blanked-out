# Types of flow
- Types of flow: laminar, turbulent, transitional (happens at very high flow rates)

# Poiseuille's equation for laminar flow

$$
Flow = \frac{\Delta P \pi r^4}{8 \eta l}
$$

Where $\Delta P$ is pressure difference, $r$ is radius, $\eta$ is viscosity, and $l$ is length. 
$$
Resistance = \frac{\Delta P}{Flow}
$$
$$
Resistance = \frac{8 \eta l}{\pi r^4}
$$
If you decrease the resistance even a little, resistance increases tremendously!
# Reynold's number
$$
Re = \frac{2rvd}{\eta}
$$
Where $r$ is radius, $v$ velocity, $d$ density, and $\eta$ viscosity. If Re exceeds 2000, flow is likely turbulent. Most airways are transitional, smaller ones are probably laminar. In the trachea, its probably turbulent.

## Changes in volume
Obviously, as you breathe in, there is going to be more volume going in to your alveoli. As you breathe out, it's going to go back up to FRC. This graph is showing tidal breathing, not really forced, which is why it's more smooth. Otherwise, you could easily ask someone to try and expel all the air from their lungs as fast as possible, and the volume would go down much more quickly,
## Intrapleural pressure
In my opinion, the sources that I've looked at don't really explain this properly. West explains this graph as the dotted line fall in intrapleural pressure during inspiration is caused by the lung's elastic recoil, and then the solid line additional drop is caused by the drop in alveolar pressure. I don't think I'm qualified to be making judgements on the explanations of others, but I think I'll do so anyway.

It doesn't make sense to say that the drop in alveolar pressure is what causes the drop in intrapleural pressure. It makes more sense to say that drop in intrapleural pressure, created by additional pulling of the pleura using the chest wall, is needed to:
1. Overcome the lung recoil pressure, which makes the lung want to collapse. This is caused by both the presence of surface tension in the alveoli, and the elastic properties of the lung (like a balloon, which doesn't 'want' to be filled with air). This is what causes the ABC dotted curve above, and looks identical to the volume tracing if lung compliance is constant (there's nothing interfering with the stretchiness of the balloon).
2. Overcome the resistance associated with the airway and create flow into the alveoli. During inspiration, the job of all these systems isn't just to keep the lung open. It's to make it **bigger** and draw more air in. It's to cause a drop in the alveolar pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure, to draw air in. 

So intrapleural pressure is what allows for flow and compensates for the lung recoil pressure. Its job is to take care of both of those things. The dotted line is what the intrapleural pressure would be if it didn't have to allow for flow into the alveoli.

During expiration, the same thing occurs. The intrapleural pressure's job isn't just to keep the lungs open during expiration. It also needs to get air out. It does so by getting the alveolar pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. That's why we see the more abrupt circular arc shapes on this graph on the solid line, and not the smoother curves that we see with the dotted line.
## Flow and alveolar pressure
This is also pretty self-explanatory. Flow makes air come in and out of the airway. The alveolar pressure drops and rises because it's clinging to the pleura, which is clinging to the chest wall. That rise and fall allows for the flow, because air goes from an area of high pressure to low pressure. 
# Airway resistance
Smaller airways usually do have more resistance BUT we can also say that
$$
A = 2^{n}
$$
Where $A$ is the number of airways and $n$ is the airway generation. Basically, there are a ton of little airways. They have a huge cross-sectional area when taken together, and so don't actually contribute that much to resistance. The main contributors as the mid-sized bronchioles.

If the radius gets reduced because of some disease, especially of these mid-sized bronchi, then the work of breathing has to be increased to maintain flow. The small, peripheral airways form a silent zone, because they don't contribute much to airway resistance. So, they could get very badly affected, and it wouldn't really affect the work of breathing, so a clinician might not pick it up.
