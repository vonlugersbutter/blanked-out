# Definition
Could also be called diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial [pneumonia](Respirology/Respiratory%20Pathologies/Pneumonia.md), cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. Some reserve fibrosis for later stages of the disease. 

Generally speaking, these diseases include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and smoking-related ILD. Pneumoconioses are a group of diseases, also restrictive, that kind of fall under this category and are caused by inhalation of dusts by workers. 
# Etiology
Idiopathic means the cause is unknown, but it might also be caused by some kind of immune reaction.
## Drugs, poisons, radiation
Acute pulmonary reaction, leading to interstitial fibrosis. This could include busulfan (chronic myeloid leukemia), nitrofurantoin, 
## Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Extrinsic allergic alveolitis
- Parenchymal lung disease, type 3 or type 4 hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled organic dusts
- Occupational or home exposure
- Precipitins in the serum

It's called extrinsic because it is external and can be identified, as opposed to the idiopathic internal stuff discussed elsewhere. 
- Could be farmer's lung from spores of thermophilic Actinomyces in moldy hay
- Bird breeder's lung due to avian antigens
- Air conditioner's lung 
- Bagassosis in bagasse; the fibrous residue of dried sugar cane after sugar extraction

Typical restrictive pattern, reduced lung volumes, low compliance, hypoxemia that worsens on exercise, normal or low arterial PCO2, reduced DLCO. 
### Pathology and features
Alveolar walls thickened, lots of lymphocytes, plasma cells, occasional eosinophils present. Collections of histiocytes that may form small granulomas. Small bronchioles affected, exudate in the lumen. Fibrotic changes occur.
#### Acute form
- All 4 to 6 hours after exposure, continue for 24 to 48 hours
	- Dyspnea
	- Fever
	- Shivering
	- Cough
	- Fine crepitations
- Normal x-ray, maybe micronodular infiltrates, ground-glass opacities
#### Chronic form
- Progressive dyspnea
- Fibrosis of the upper lobes on both x-ray and CT
### Treatment
Eliminate the offending antigen, long courses of corticosteroids.
# Epidemiology
Not really common, found usually in old people. 
# Pathophysiology
The interstitium thickens, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells ensues. Fibroblasts lay down thick collagen bundles. Lung compliance is, obviously, severely reduced. Desquamation is where, in the early stages of the disease, exudate with macrophages and immune cells can be found in the alveoli. Alveoli are destroyed, scarring results, and air-filled cystic spaces get formed by dilated bronchioles. This is 'honeycomb' lung.

Transpulmonary pressure will be abnormally high because intrapleural pressure is very low, and the maximum recoil pressure generated at TLC is higher than normal. Fibrous tissue reduces the distensibility of the lungs, causing scar tissue. The patient needs much more pressure just to get the same volume. Airways do tend to narrow as the lung volume is reduced. But, it's important to note that the airway resistance is actually normal or decreased, because the surrounding parenchyma pulls on the airway (again, the honeycomb pattern).

Pulmonary vascular resistance will be increased, because of the lack of ventilation and pulmonary vasoconstriction compensation. This could potentially lead to right heart failure. Blood volume of pulmonary capillaries is decreased because many vessels are obliterated. There will be hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscles, and narrowing of small arteries, which contributes to pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac output is very high in these patients. 
## Ventilation-perfusion relationships to explain hypoxemia
Ah, my favourite. There is hypoxemia in these patients. It may be because the diffusion of oxygen from gas to blood is worse because the barrier between then is thickened. That would cause inadequate ventilation. Exercise reduces the amount of time spent by the red blood cells in the pulmonary capillary, which also causes impaired diffusion. 

But according to West, this is not the chief cause. The normal lung has reserves of diffusion, so the PO2 in the blood is around the same as alveolar gas, early on in its transit. There's a lot of V-Q inequality, because of how disorganized everything is in these patients. West regards this as the primary mechanism of hypoxemia, while the diffusion limitation is really only more significant on exercise. 

Especially in exercise, O2 uptake and CO2 output will increase, so the alveolar PO2 will rise and the alveolar CO2 will fall. However, the arterial O2 will fall, so the A-a gradient will increase. 
## PCO2 
PCO2 is low, because it diffuses well and can get out easily. So, arterial pH is also fine. During exercise it might increase, but that's only because of hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid accumulation might happen in late exercise, but this all feels very normal. 
## Shallow, rapid breathing on exercise
Reflexes of irritant receptors (bronchi or epithelial lining, stimulated by increased traction on airways because of increased elastic recoil of lungs) or juxtacapillary receptors (on alveolar walls, stimulated by fibrotic changes in interstitium). This pattern of breathing reduces respiratory work, but it also increases ventilation of dead space rather than alveoli, so there's a compromise here. 
# Investigations
- Chest x-ray shows reticular or reticulonodular pattern, especially at bases
- CT scan is good at showing honeycomb pattern, and may also show airways pulled open by surrounding fibrous tissue (traction dilatation)
- Lungs are small, diaphragms raised
- Spirometry will show low FVC, FEV1 is low, but the ratio FEV/FVC is normal or abnormally high
- No scooped out on flow-volume curve, the way you'd see on obstructive disease 
- Lung volumes are all reduced, like TLC, FRC, RV â†’ but the relative proportions are preserved

Pressure-volume curve is flattened, so elastic recoil is reduced.

Note the small contracted lungs, the raised diaphragm, netlike opacities in both lungs, especially the bases.

DLCO will be very reduced. That can be used as a diagnostic measure.
